# rdgen

`rdgen` is a recursive-descent parser generator that emits idiomatic parser
code and concrete typed AST nodes. It is designed as an alternative to ANTLR
for grammars where generated hand-written-style parsing logic and direct AST
construction are preferable to a generic parse-tree runtime.

The workspace is organized around a language-agnostic IR. The grammar DSL
compiler resolves rule references, constructor bindings, recovery points, and
precedence tables into `rdgen-ir`; target-specific emitters consume that IR.
The Rust emitter is the reference backend, followed by C and C++.
